# TintFix
Tries to somewhat mitigate greenish tint on Sony Xperia 10 III devices.

## How?
See this [thread](https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/green-tint-on-oled.4289057/) on the XDA. Special thanks to `combinedfleet` for the idea.

## Dependency
- [`com.sonyericsson.album`](https://github.com/Mnkai/TintFix/blob/master/assets/com.sonyericsson.album.apk)
    
## Setup
1. Build and install the app with Gradle.
2. Put included `vid.mp4` in the `/sdcard/tintfix` folder.
3. Install included `com.sonyericsson.album` (or if you can, install from the reputable sources) to the phone.
    1. Launch it once, and give the app external storage permission.

## Usage
1. Launch the app. The app will exit automatically.
